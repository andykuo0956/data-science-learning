# Data Science Learning
This repository contains my personal notes and code examples related to the following machine learning algorithms:

- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to document my personal learning journey in data science and machine learning. Each algorithm has its own directory, which contains code examples and notes on theory, implementation, and practical applications.

## Algorithms
### Decision Tree
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. In this directory, you will find code examples and notes on how to build, visualize, and interpret decision trees.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and effective algorithm for classification and regression tasks. In this directory, you will find code examples and notes on how to implement KNN in Python and how to optimize its performance.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a widely used statistical technique for binary classification problems. In this directory, you will find code examples and notes on how to build and interpret logistic regression models in Python.

### Random Forest
Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees. In this directory, you will find code examples and notes on how to build and evaluate random forest models in Python.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful and flexible algorithm for classification, regression, and other tasks. In this directory, you will find code examples and notes on how to implement SVM in Python and how to optimize its performance.
